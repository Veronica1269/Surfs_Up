# Surfs Up

Describe the key differences in weather between June and December for the island of Oahu and make two recommendations for further analysis.




## Overview of the Analysis


The goal of this analysis is to investigate temperature variations on the Hawaiian island of Oahu in order to determine the viability of a business that combines the sale of surfing products with the sale of milkshakes and ice cream. Surf 'n Shake will be the name of the store. The data will be used to persuade local investors to join forces in the creation of this business.




## Results 

Below is the temperatures for the month of June: 


	- June had a min of **64.00**, max of **85.0** and a mean of **74.9**.

The difference in the standard deviation between June and December was only **0.49** since the standard deviation for June is "**3.25**" and "**3.74**" in December, showing there is not a significant difference in the two months. 




## Summary 


Overall, running a surf shop from Oahu seems like a profitable business as the weather during the winter is not too cold. Since there are only two seasons in Hawaii, fall and winter, it would be insightful to run a query on precipitation data as this can severely influence conditions for surfing. Depending on how much data is collected by the stations we could also run a query on areas of the island that have better tides or are located closer to tourist spots that can guarantee more customers and revenue for the business.
